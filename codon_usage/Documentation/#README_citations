If you publish work using the programs or utilities to generate a native codon
usage axis, please cite:
 
     Davis, J. J., and Olsen, G. J.  2010.  Characterizing the Native Codon
     Usages of a Genome: An axis projection approach. submitted.

Hopefully it will be published by the time you use it, in which case, please
update the citation.

If you publish work using the programs or utilities to generate a modal codon
usage, please cite:

    Davis, J. J., and Olsen, G. J.  2009.  Modal Codon Usage:  Assessing the
    typical codon usage of a genome. doi:10.1093/molbev/msp281.

Hopefully this will have a date and issue by the time you use it, in which
case, please update the citation.

Your citations of the programs and databases you use is how funding agencies
know what is valuable to you, the scientific community.
