# Assigning Functions to Uncharacterized Genes

Leveraging machine learning and AI to predict functions of characterized and uncharacterized genes using K-mers, ensemble methods, and LLM embeddings

## About This Project

This is a project from the **NIAID BRC AI Codeathon 2025**, taking place November 12-14, 2025 at Argonne National Laboratory.

## Codeathon Goals

The NIAID Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) invite researchers, data scientists, and developers to a three-day AI Codeathon focused on improving Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR-ness) of BRC data and tools using artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs).
